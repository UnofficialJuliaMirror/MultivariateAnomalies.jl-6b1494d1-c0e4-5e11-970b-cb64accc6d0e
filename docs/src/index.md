## Requirements

- Julia `0.4`
- `Distances`, `MultivariateStats`
-  latest `LIBSVM` branch via:
`Pkg.clone("https://github.com/milanflach/LIBSVM.jl.git")`
`Pkg.checkout("LIBSVM", "mutating_versions")`
`Pkg.build("LIBSVM")`

## Package Features

- Extract the relevant features from the data 
```@contents
Pages = ["man/FeatureExtraction.md"]
```
- Compute Distance, Kernel matrices and k-nearest neighbors objects 
```@contents
Pages = ["man/DistDensity.md"]
```
- Detect the anomalies
```@contents
Pages = ["man/DetectionAlgorithms.md"]
```
- Postprocess your anomaly scores, by computing their quantiles or ensembles
```@contents
Pages = ["man/Scores"]
```
- Compute the area under the curve as external evaluation metric
```@contents
Pages = ["man/AUC"]
```

## Using the Package

We provide high-level convenience functions for detecting the anomalies. Namely the pair of 

`P = getParameters(algorithms, training_data)` and
`detectAnomalies(testing_data, P)`

sets standard choices of the Parameters `P` and hands the parameters as well as the algorithms choice over to detect the anomalies. 

Currently supported algorithms include Kernel Density Estimation (`algorithms = ["KDE"]`), Recurrences (`"REC"`), k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms (`"KNN-Gamma"`, `"KNN-Delta"`), Hotelling's T^2 (`"T2"`), Support Vector Data Description (`"SVDD"`) and Kernel Null Foley Summon Transform (`"KNFST"`). With `getParameters()` it is also possible to compute output scores of multiple algorithms at once (`algorihtms = ["KDE", "T2"]`), quantiles of the output anomaly scores (`quantiles = true`) and ensembles of the selected algorithms (e.g. `ensemble_method = "mean"`). For more details about the detection algorithms and their usage please consider

## Input Data

Within MultivariateAnomalies we assume that observations/samples/time steps are stored along the first dimension of the data array (rows of a matrix) with the number of observations `T = size(data, 1)`. Variables/attributes are stored along the last dimension `N` of the data array (along the columns of a matrix) with the number of variables `VAR = size(data, N)`. We are interested in the question which observation(s) of the data are anomalous.
